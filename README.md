# NeuroCuddl
NeuroCuddl is a novel phone based VR headset to provide the user with an immersive environment for both mental health and vivid recreational experiences. Comprehensive relaxation is provided to the various senses by stimulating muscles, playing synthesized music and showcasing dynamic visuals all of which are modulated by the user's breathing pattern and mental state. Breathing patterns are comfortably measured using a contact microphone in the nasal region. The system would interface to a VR ready smartphone over BLE and provide analog pulsations to control TENS unit (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) output which provides soft &amp; soothing stimulations for the shoulder muscles.
