# NeuroCuddl
NeuroCuddl is a novel VR headset to provide the user with an immersive environment for both mental health and vivid recreational experiences. Relaxation is provided using muscle stimulation and synthesized music modulated by the user's breathing pattern & mental state. Breathing patterns are comfortably measured using a contact microphone in the nasal region. The sensor is interfaced to the primary MCU connected to a compatible smartphone over BLE. The MCU also generates context aware analog pulsations of various types to control the TENS unit (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) output which provides soft & soothing stimulations for the shoulder muscles. Music is generated dynamically using the breathing pattern as biofeedback along with visuals showcased to the users. NeuroCuddl aims to provide a positive reinforcement based mental health training.
